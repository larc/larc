### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Zurich (since 2019) and an early-stage researcher in the EVOCATION innovative training network. I have received my MSc in Computer Science from the Federal Fluminense University, Niteroi - Brazil (2017). Prior, I have earned my BSc in Computer Science from the National University of Saint Augustine, Arequipa - Peru (2014). My research interests focus on real-time ray tracing, geometry processing, computational geometry, geometry deep learning and shape analysis. Also, Iâ€™m interested in algorithms, data structures, graphs, and parallel programming. I like to solve competitive programming problems within my free time.
