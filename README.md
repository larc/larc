### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD(c) and Research Assistant at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. I obtained my MSc from the Fluminense Federal University, Brazil, and my BSc in Computer Science from the National University of San AgustÃ­n, Arequipa. I was an early-stage researcher in the [EVOCATION](https://evocation.eu/) innovative training network. My research interests cover the following topics: real-time ray tracing, point cloud graphics, multi-display and parallel rendering, geometry processing, and geometric deep learning, in addition to my ongoing interest in algorithms, data structures, graphs, computational geometry, and competitive programming.
